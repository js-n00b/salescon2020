//Important note to do to re-publishing of this Keyboard_canvas.

1) Set Lib to Asset at publish setting, to prevent clashing with other keyboard of project
2) Editing of the canvas code: Some buttons were renamed by createjs due to having same instance name,
	example pbKey_1 on num keyboard and (renamed)pbKey_1_1 on qwerty keyboard
	revert the names to the correct naming pbKey_1_1 -> pbKey_1, this will not affect the function.
3) Note on edit the addChild too when doing point 2.

addition keyboard can be added from project through mImportKB

mImportKB[unique name] = keyboard from project

Setting the unique name at textfield ShowKeyboard will let Main handle the keyboard
however, note! The keyboard needs to be added to stage and should not have non-keyboard element.
All button's click will be replace by cKeyboard's click handle therefore won't return non-keyboard element.
